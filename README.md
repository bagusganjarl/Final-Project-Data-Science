# **Used Car Auction Prices Machine Learning Model**

## **Introduction**
A final project of Data Science Bootcamp Batch 20 in [Rakamin Academy](https://www.rakamin.com/). In this project, as a **Data Scientist** from used car dealer company in United States has responsibility to give recommendation to face the current problem through machine learning.

## **Dataset**
This dataset obtained from **Kaggle** [Used Car Auction Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/used-car-auction-prices). Dataset using historical data of sold used car in United States moreless **2 years before**.

## **Problem Statement**
1. The **time** needed to predict the prices of a used car is less **effective** and **efficient**,
2. Customers of used cars have not yet received a **value-for-money** guarantee.

## **Goal**
Increase **the accuracy** of the value and **speed of time** in determining the prices of a used car so that it can improve **car sales performance**.

## **Objective**
Build **machine learning model** to predict used car

## **Business Metrics**
- **Appraisal Time**
- **Sales Revenue**

## **Stage**
In this project, we divide into **4 stages**:
1. **Stage 1 - Preparation**: We learn about the project and dataset that has been choosen. The key-takeaways in this stage is who we are in this project, **the problem statement**, **goal** and **objective** that we want to achieve and the last is **business metrics**.
2. **Stage 2 - EDA**: We start to reach the dataset to gain the characteristic from the data. We separate the process into 3 steps, start from **exploration data**, **EDA**, and gather **insight** about the dataset related to the main problem and goals.
3. **Stage 3 - Preprocessing**: We handle the data become the cleanest data before start the modelling process. We cleansing some **missing values**, **duplicate data**, **outliers** and determine the **feature engineering** we choose.
4. **Stage 4 - Supervised Learning**: We enter the modelling process and explore several **algorithm** to enhance based on **feature** and **target** that we been choosed.

## **Team**
We called the project name as **Car-A-Thon**. Team behind this project for final project of **Data Science Bootcamp Batch 20 Rakamin Academy**:
