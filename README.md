# Final-Project-Data-Science
A final project of Data Science bootcamp batch 20 in Rakamin Academy.

Stage 0 - Preparation
On this stage, we learn about the project and dataset that has been choosen. The key-takeaways in this stage is who we are in this project, the problem statement, goal and objective that we want to achieve and the last is business metrics.

Stage 1 - EDA
On this stage, we start to reach the dataset to gain the characteristic from the data. We separate the process into 3 steps, start from exploration data, EDA, and gather insight about the dataset related to the main problem and goals.

Stage 2 - Preprocessing
On this stage, we handle the data become the cleanest data before start the modelling process. We cleansing some missing values, duplicate data, outliers and determine the feature engineering we choose.

Stage 3 - Supervised Learning
On this stage, we enter the modelling process and explore several algorithm to enhance the dataset.
